The "The Issue of Pattern Recognition in EEG Signals" project focuses on analyzing electroencephalogram (EEG) data collected during an experiment involving individuals exposed to virtual reality (VR) videos with varying emotional content. The objective is to extract frequency and statistical features from EEG signals using techniques like the Fisher method and evolutionary algorithms. These features are then utilized to build Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) and Radial Basis Function (RBF) models for pattern recognition. Cross-validation techniques are employed to assess the models' performance, which are trained on labeled data and tested on separate datasets to evaluate their ability to differentiate between neural responses to positive and negative stimuli. This project aims to contribute insights into the application of machine learning in analyzing EEG signals and understanding human cognitive and emotional processes.
