The project, "The Issue of Pattern Recognition in EEG Signals," focuses on classifying emotional responses elicited during the viewing of VR videos using EEG data. The experiment involved collecting EEG signals while participants watched VR videos containing positive, neural and negative content. Frequency and statistical features were extracted from the EEG signals using the Fisher method and evolutionary algorithms. Two types of neural network classifiers, Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) and Radial Basis Function (RBF) networks, were constructed and trained using cross-validation. This project aims to contribute insights into the application of machine learning in analyzing EEG signals and understanding human cognitive and emotional processes.
